 * @description
 * CWE: 319 Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
 * BadSource: URLConnection Read password from a web server with URLConnection
 * GoodSource: Set password to a hardcoded value (one that was not sent over the network)
 * Sinks: driverManager
 *    GoodSink: Decrypt the password from the source before using it in database connection
 *    BadSink : Use password directly from source in database connection
 * Flow Variant: 22 Control flow: Flow controlled by value of a public static variable. Sink functions are in a separate file from sources.
